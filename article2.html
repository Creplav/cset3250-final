            Graphics cards have been hard to come by recently due to the huge uprise of mining. Card manufactures have not been able
            to keep up with the demand and thus prices have been much higher than normal. There has been the announcement
            of a new Ethereum ASIC miner which is said to be priced around $800. It seems that demand for graphics cards
            has come down since shipments have reportedly decreased by 20-40%. If this is true we may be looking at a decrease
            in price of graphics cards finally after months of them being sky high.
