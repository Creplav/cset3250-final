        <h1>What are cryptocurrencies?</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are a digital currency that can be used as normal fiat money where accepted. They use cryptography
            to secure their transactions and are decentralized meaning that the government does not control them.</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies can be obtained in several ways such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Mining</li>
                <li>Trading</li>
                <li>Faucets</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>How do cryptocurrencies work?</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies live in what is called a
            <b>blockchain</b>. A blockchain is a type of ledger. It allows for the currency to be distributed around the world.
            The blockchain holds transaction data in what is called a block hence the name.
        </p>
        <p>The ledger is maintained by
            <b>miners</b>. Miners are people who use specialized computers to run special software that checks the blockchain
            to make sure the transactions are valid and heading in the right direction
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Faucets</b> are websites that will periodically give out a small amount of currency. 
            However, faucets can be unsafe. Usually the websites are not built very securely and can be subject to hacks. 
            Faucets also sometimes require you to complete surveys or watch a lot of ads to obtain the currency. 
            Completing surveys requires you to give out personal information and most surveys will not let you continue 
            without a valid email address which can lead to your spam folder in your email filling up. It is not 
            uncommon for ads from a source like that to contain viruses. If you decided to use a faucet make sure 
            you exercise caution. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Trading</b> is just what it sounds like. It works very similar to the way the stock market does. 
            If you want to make any money with your crypto you will eventually need to trade. 
            You can buy or sell currencies on a trading site such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I get into cryptocurrencies?</h2>
        <p>In order to own a cryptocurrency you need to have what is called a <b>wallet</b>.
            Wallets hold the currency and are secured by a digital key. 
            They have an address that you can direct crypto to when you buy or obtain some. 
            You will need a wallet for each type of cryptocurrency you own as each has its own specific architecture. 
            There are multiple ways to get a wallet. One is to use software to generate one for you. 
            Another is to use a service that provides one for you such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>.
