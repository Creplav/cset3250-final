        <p>Cryptocurriences fell dramatically in Feburary. 
            They came back up some but then hit the slopes again in March and haven't really recovered since.</p>
        <p>Now they are on the rise again. Will this be their comeback to all-time high prices? Some say no. 
            Others say that it might be. Due to the nature of cryptocurrencies and how volatile they are we aren't quite sure. 
            We do know that they seem to follow a pattern of steep decline and then sharp inclines in prices. 
            We believe that the rise in price will come shortly. There is currently an incline in prices so it may be happening now.
